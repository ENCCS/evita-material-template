## Instructor guide

### Teaching hours and number of participants

This module is developed for one instructor and two teaching assistants during teaching for 40 students. The teaching can be delivered online, onsite, or in a hybrid format, providing flexibility to accommodate different learning preferences and circumstances. Whether students attend in person or remotely, the course materials and exercises are designed to ensure a consistent and engaging learning experience. Instructors can leverage virtual tools such as video conferencing and shared coding environments alongside traditional classroom setups to support all modes of delivery effectively.

Students are expected to dedicate 2-4 hours in total. This estimate combines contact hours, such as lectures or exercises (1~2 hours), with independent learning time (1-2 hours), which include self-study, assignments, and revision. Balancing these components ensures students have sufficient guided instruction while allowing ample time for personal engagement with the material.

### Mode of teaching and exercising

Before teaching this module, the instructor is expected to set up the programming environment on the HPC cluster or assist students with installing the necessary packages on their personal computers. During exercises, instructors may use Jupyter notebooks for demonstrations or copy and paste code examples from the webpage into script files. These scripts can then be executed on studentsâ€™ personal computers or the HPC cluster, providing a flexible learning experience.

### Hardware requirements on HPC clusters

The HPC cluster used for this course should be equipped with modern NVIDIA GPUs that support CUDA programming. It is recommended that the cluster allocates a minimum of 20 GPU hours per person throughout the course duration. This allocation ensures sufficient time for code development, testing, and running computationally intensive workloads. A minimum of 16 GB GPU memory is recommended to handle large datasets and complex computations efficiently.
